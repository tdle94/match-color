# match-color
My first game written in Swift using spritekit framework. 
Compatible for iphone series 
The objective is to match the color of the snake's head with the color of
the block. You lose by shortening all the snake's body

I am still trying to enhance the snake's movement. Right now it is just moving in the x and y direction without swiggling like the real snake
